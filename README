🎓 MJU AI Assistant: Real-Time University Notice Agent

Project Overview

The MJU AI Assistant is a real-time, conversational application designed to help Myongji University students quickly access crucial academic, scholarship, and career notices directly from the university website. It uses Gemini's Function Calling capability to dynamically execute a local web crawler tool based on user intent, providing highly specific and up-to-date information instantly.

This project demonstrates a robust, production-ready full-stack architecture focusing on performance, scalability, and modern user experience.

Key Technical Features

This project highlights several professional engineering practices:

1. Agentic Workflow via Function Calling

LLM Integration: Utilizes the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API to interpret natural language queries (e.g., "Tell me about scholarships").

Dynamic Tool Use: The LLM dynamically selects the appropriate notice board ID (255, 257, 259, etc.) from the user's intent and passes it to the custom Python tool (get_mju_notices).

Intent Resolution: Implemented robust keyword-to-ID mapping logic in Python to accurately resolve vague user requests into specific URL codes, ensuring high reliability.

2. High-Performance Local Tool Integration

Architecture Refactor: Successfully resolved critical "Cold Start Latency" issues inherent in subprocess-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) solutions.

Zero-Overhead Execution: Refactored the web scraping module (crawler.py) for direct, local execution within the Flask server process, dramatically reducing response time by eliminating process forking overhead.

Robust Web Scraping: Uses requests and BeautifulSoup4 for reliable, fast fetching and clean parsing of specific, complex HTML structures.

3. Full-Stack Features & Deployment

Professional Authentication: Implemented secure Google OAuth 2.0 login using the Authlib library, managing user sessions and profile information.

Deployment: Fully containerized and deployed on Render (Python/gunicorn runtime) for continuous, free cloud hosting.

Code Quality: Applied English Type Hinting (Python), Semantic HTML5, and separated CSS/JS for high maintainability and readability (a core principle for collaborative development).

4. Responsive UI/UX Design

Desktop Dashboard: Utilizes a clean, split-screen dashboard layout with Quick Links, styled using the MJU navy blue official colors.

Mobile-First Design: Achieved perfect mobile compatibility using the dvh (Dynamic Viewport Height) unit and CSS media queries, correctly handling mobile toolbars and safe areas.

Custom UI Components: Created a professional custom modal for developer contact, replacing disruptive native browser alerts.

🏗️ Architecture Diagram (LLM-Tool Flow)

The system is designed around fast, local tool execution:

User Input (Frontend)

Flask Backend (app.py): Receives POST request.

Gemini API: Reads user message + Tool Definition.

Tool Execution: Gemini determines the board ID ("257" for Academic) and calls the local Python function call_crawler_tool(category='257').

Local Crawler: Python runs get_mju_notices('257'), fetches data from the MJU website, and returns a clean JSON/text list.

Gemini API: Uses the list to generate a summarized, markdown response.

Frontend: Receives markdown and renders it beautifully (with clickable links).
